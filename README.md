# WCSP Web Scraping
A R script to extract information from the World Checklist of Selected Plants (http://wcsp.science.kew.org/home.do)

 The WCSP being not allowing to download spreadsheet (e.g. .csv) containing the data present in the checklist, I propose here a script allowing it by using web-scraping. The Web-Scraping is exploiting the HTML code structure in order to localize and extract information on a given webpage.
